## About this documentation

The main purpose of this documentation is to introduce you into the world of Goma. It will guide you through the process of setting up Goma Server with a third party Remote Build Execution backend. At the end of this guide you should have a basic Goma setup ready to remotely execute some jobs. Although this will not be a production ready setup it should be a good starting point for further development.

## Disclaimer

This is not an official Goma documentation. You can find official Goma documentation [here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/goma/server). This is a non-official documentation that is based on my own experiences with Goma. Use it on your own risk.
