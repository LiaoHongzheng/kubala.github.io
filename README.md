## Disclaimer

This is not an official Goma documentation. You can find official Goma documentation [here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/goma/server). This is a non-official documentation that is based on my own experiences with Goma. Use it on your own risk.

## About this documentation

The main purpose of this documentation is to introduce you into the world of Goma. It will guide you from the process of coupling Goma with a third party RBE backend into the more advanced topics of Goma internals.
